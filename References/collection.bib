Cells acquire a positional value with respect to boundaries and then interpret this in terms of a programme determined by their genetic constitution and developmental history. The signals and the molecular basis of such a system have both been rather well conserved. Recent work has shown that cells can respond to quite small differences in the concentrations of molecules whose concentration could provide positional information.},

	abstract     = {A Turing model for pattern generation on Lady beetles is considered. This motivates the construction of numerical algorithms for solving reaction-diffusion equations on the sphere. By applying a Galerkin approximation in space, and the implicit Euler method for timestepping, the equation is fully discretized. Convergence orders are proven for this scheme. To obtain a more efficient time stepping algorithm an implicit-explicit splitting is introduced. Some numerical experiments are then performed which demonstrates the superior efficiency of the splitting method. The experiments also verifies the pattern generating ability of the Turing model.},

	abstract = {Many organisms exhibit visually striking spotted or striped pigmentation patterns. Turing{\textquoteright}s reaction-diffusion model postulates that such periodic pigmentation patterns form when a local autocatalytic feedback loop and a long-range inhibitory feedback loop interact. At its simplest, this network only requires one self-activating activator that also activates a repressor, which inhibits the activator and diffuses to neighboring cells. However, the molecular activators and repressors fully fitting this versatile model remain elusive. Here, we characterize an R2R3-MYB activator and an R3-MYB repressor in monkeyflowers that correspond to Turing{\textquoteright}s model and explain how periodic anthocyanin spots form. Notably, disrupting this pattern impacts pollinator visitation. Thus, subtle changes in simple reaction-diffusion networks are likely essential contributors to the evolution of the remarkable diversity of periodic pigmentation patterns in flowers.},
