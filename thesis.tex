  \begin{thesisabstract}  
Procedural method provides an algorithmic way to produce textures for use in computer graphics. One such method, named reaction-diffusion, is a powerful mathematical approach with both biological and visual relevance. This thesis describes \ProgramName{}, an environment for authoring reaction-diffusion models on arbitrary surfaces. Morphogens, their behaviours, and the domain in which they reside can be quickly and easily declared. By performing computation on the GPU, the pattern forming simulation can be interacted with in real-time, facilitating productivity and experimentation. Four case studies are presented. The first is a simulation of ladybug pigmentation patterns. The second models pigmentation patterns seen on the body of snakes. The third study looks at flower petal pattern modelling. Last, a biologically motivated model of the autoimmune disease psoriasis is presented.
