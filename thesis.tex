I would like to acknowledge my supervisor Dr. Prusinkiewicz for all his guidance and support. I would also like to thank the members of the Algorithmic Botany lab including Andrew Owens, Jeremy Hart, Cory Bloor, Mik Cieslak, Philmo Gu, and Pascal Ferraro as well as Desmond Larsen-Rosner. Your advice and thoughtful conversations greatly helped me to learn, develop, and enjoy this work.
