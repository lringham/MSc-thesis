\chapter{Conclusions}
\section{Summary}
Procedural generation of natural patterns is often performed using reaction-diffusion. Nature is full of engaging patterns and through the science we wish to discover the mechanisms that create these patterns. Modelling our hypotheses provides a quick way to test the character of iteractions. In this thesis I have detailed how the \ProgramName{} program works and through case studies shown its utility. \ProgramName{} provides a quick, expressive and efficient way to author reaction-diffusion patterns on triangular meshes. 

\section{Future Work}
Most patterns in biology do not only occur in a 2 dimensional layer. Adding support for tetrahedral models could allow for representation and exploration of more realistic models with thickness. Support for user selection of different integration methods will allow for more flexibility when modelling. Coupling bidirectional feedback between growth and morphogen concentrations would also allow for more realistic modelling. Finer control of boundary conditions, would increase the expressibility of models. Support for CPU multi-threading or distributed computing can also increase the software run-time and productivity of users. Right now the only tested and support operating system is Windows. Adding cross-platform support would make \ProgramName{} more usable. Some basic features as in model loading during runtime would increase the quality of life for users as well as leveraging an established design language found in existing software.
