\label{appendix:Reservedlabels}

% List of reserved parameter file labels and their descriptions
\begin{description}[itemsep=0cm]
    \item[ModelsPath:] Filepath to folder containing OBJ models.
    \item[ColorMapsPath:] Filepath to folder containing colormaps.
    \item[ShadersPath:] Filepath to folder containing shaders.
    \item[ffmpegPath:] Filepath to folder containing ffmpeg.exe for video creation.
    \item[camera:] Six comma separated floating point values representing the position and look at points used to orient the camera.
    \item[model:] Nine comma separated floating point values representing the X, Y, Z vectors used to orient the domain. 
    \item[domain:] The domain as either an OBJ filename (eg. model.obj) or grid. Only manifold OBJ meshes are supported. Grid domains look for two other parameters \textit{width} and \textit{height} which denote grid resolution.
    \item[width:] Integer representing width in squares of grid domain.
    \item[height:] Integer representing height in squares of grid domain.
    \item[simFile:] A filename of a text file containing all per vertex values such as morphogen concentrations, vector directions and principle diffusivities. (eg. simfile.rd)
    \item[colorMap:] A filename of binary file containing a 256 RGB colormap. This is used for both inside and outside the mesh (eg. color.map).
    \item[colorMapOutside:] The colormap for the outside of the mesh.
    \item[colorMapInside:] The colormap for the inside of the mesh.
    \item[growthTickLimit:] An integer representing the number of simulation steps before the domain is grown.
    \item[growing:] \textit{true} or \textit{false} to turn growth on or off.
    \item[growthX:] A floating percentage representing growth percentage on global X axis.
    \item[growthY:] A floating percentage representing growth percentage on global Y axis.
    \item[growthZ:] A floating percentage representing growth percentage on global Z axis.
    \item[maxFaceSize:] The face area threshold as a float for adaptive subdivision.
    \item[areaScale:] A floating point value that scales the area associated with each vertex.
    \item[morphogens:] A comma separated list of morphogen names in uppercase (eg. A, S, U, V).
    \item[initialConditions:] The start of initial condition specification.
    \item[rdModel:] Either GPU or CPU depending on desired computation mode. Also denotes the
    \item[indices:] Specifies integer indices used to define initial conditions and parameters. Valid values are: all or 1,2,3 or 1-3.
