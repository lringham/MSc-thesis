\chapter{Case Study 1: Ladybug patterns}

\section{Literature Review}
The ladybug (also known as ladybird beetle or lady beetle) is an insect in the family Coccinellidae. They are a small round beetle that ranges in length from 0.8 to 18mm \citep{King1996} and are often found in leaf piles and gardens. Ladybugs exist throughout the world and display a myriad of spot and stripe pigmentation patterns on their elytra: the two symmetric hard shells on the dorsal side of the insect. The elytra's main purpose is to protect the fragile wings located underneath and the pattern is thought to deter predators by indicating that the ladybug is bitter tasting \citep{King1996}. The pattern on one elytron is a mirror image of the pattern on the other.

Understanding the ladybug life cycle can give insight into how and when their patterns form. The cycle starts with eggs laid on the underside of leaves. These eggs hatch into larvae, which then eat aphids and other food sources until they can pupate and metamorphose into adults. Immediately after pupation, the elytra appear patternless and are a pale-yellow colour. In a timespan of hours to days, dark spots emerge and become black. The yellow transitions to red, giving the ladybug its characteristic appearance. Although certain species of ladybugs are described by the number of spots on their elytra, there can be a variable number and shape of spots found on ladybugs of the same species.

\citet{Ando2018} explored the genetic mechanisms governing formation of ladybug patterns. They found a gene, \textit{pannier}, which is responsible for much of the observed pigmentation patterns in \textit{Harmonia axyridis} and \textit{Coccinella septempunctata}. Before any pigment is visible, \textit{pannier} is found in a pre-pattern on the elytra. It then promotes melanin (black) and inhibits carotenoids (red) pigmentation accumulation creating a visible pattern. Future work is needed to identify if other specific genes are involved in pigmentation expression.

Although the specific genetic mechanisms behind the pattern formation are not fully known, \citet{Liaw2001} used reaction-diffusion to simulate visually similar ladybug patterns. The equations used are activator-depleted substrate with saturation. Their results were obtained numerically by using forward Euler integration on a grid and then mapping the results onto a partial sphere. Diffusion on the partial sphere is computed by assuming a radius of 1 and using a Laplacian defined in spherical coordinates. It was found that the domain boundary and the curvature change the final position of spots and stripes. Five models were proposed. Three species considered display black spots on a red/orange background. In particular, \textit{Platynaspidius quinquepunctatus}, \textit{Coccinella septempunctata}, and \textit{Epilachna crassimala} display 5, 7, and 10 spots respectively. \textit{Macroilleis hauseri} has brown stripes aligned with the long axis of the shell on a yellow background. \textit{Bothrocalvia albolineata} displays elongated orange loops on a brown background.

\section{Model Description} 
I used \ProgramName{} to extend these models onto a triangular mesh. The equations remain the activator-depleted substrate formula \citep{Meinhardt1982}:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:ladybugRD}
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \rho_u \frac{u^2v}{1+\kappa u^2} + \sigma_u - \mu_u u + D_u \Lap u, \\
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &= -\rho_v \frac{u^2v}{1+\kappa u^2} + \sigma_v + D_v \Lap v.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Morphogens are represented by $u$ and $v$ and the former is displayed as the pigmentation on the elytra. The rate of conversion of $v$ into $u$ is determined by $\rho_u$. Similarly, $\rho_v$ represents how much $v$ is used in the conversion to $u$. $\kappa$ controls saturation, $\sigma_u$ and $\sigma_v$ are the base production rates, and $\mu_u$ is the decay of $u$. $\Lap$ is the discrete Laplacian with the diffusion rates being $D_u$ and $D_v$ for $u$ and $v$. This is similar to Eqn \ref{eq:activatorSubstrateRD} with saturation.

The domain of the simulation is a convex open triangular mesh mimicking the real shape of the elytra. The boundary conditions are no-flux and the shell is considered one piece. Thus, diffusion is allowed across the centre where the elytra are physically separated. This raises an interesting question as to if diffusion is actually occuring across the seperation or if the elytra are at one point joined during pupation. The one exception is \textit{B. albolineata} which contains a sink along the middle of the elytra simulating a sink where two halves meet.

\section{Results}
I was able produce most visually similar ladybug patterns as they appear in \citep{Liaw2001}, shown in Fig \ref{fig:ladyBugPatterns}. There are small differences between the patterns formed on a partial sphere and an arbitrary mesh using the original parameters. These discrepancies are thought to occur from the mesh not being spherical and the irregularities in the initial morphogen distributions arising from the mesh triangulation. One difference was that the number of spots on C was less then 10, to rectify this, I lowered $D_v$ from $0.04$ to $0.024$. Also, the spots were not arranged in 3 rows. This phenomenon was achieved by changing the initial morphogen distribution to just a stripe at the top as opposed to a distribution seen in A and B. $\sigma_u$ was then increased from $0$ to $0.01$, allowing for horizontal lines to form which turn into spots over time. This approach can produce similar patterns  with a different number of spots by only varying the diffusion rate of $u$. Another discrepancy observed with the initial parameters was that the stripes in D and E turned into spots and irregular lines near the boundary. In D, the initial morphogens propagate as a wave, leaving stripes in its wake. On a mesh, the wave was observed to outpace itself in places causing it to self-interact and destroy the vertical line pattern. I have decreased $\kappa$ from $0.35$ to $0.05$, strengthening the tendency to form lines. I also changed the initial distribution from a vertical stripe of $u$ down the centre to include stripes along the boundary (excluding the top). This has the effect of aligning the pattern by reducing the distance the middle wave must travel and avoiding the self interaction. To account for lines becoming spots in E, the total simulation steps is reduced to 500,000 from the original model's 1,500,000 steps. Both my model and \citep{Liaw2001} use a morphogen sink along the centre of the elytra to create the loop pattern. But, in both models, there is also a gap not seen in nature. This is formed where the sink is located. Patterns observed in D seem to be a good fit for modelling E as well. The complete list of parameters is shown in Table \ref{tab:ladyBugParameters}.

\section{Discussion and future work}
These models produce patterns on a triangular mesh and are visually similar to real ladybugs. Previously, the domain ladybug patterns were simulated on was restricted to spherical surfaces. This work allows for arbitrary surfaces which can more closely model real ladybug elytra. The changes to initial conditions and parameters provide an alternative to those found in \citep{Liaw2001}. Improvements to these models can be made once the biological chemical interactions are fully understood. The most relevant insights would be, the real initial distribution of morphogens, and the actual reaction behaviour between morphogens. Further investigation should be made to determine if morphogens really diffuse across the gap in the elytra. Also, how much do patterns found on the head of the ladybug effect the elytra pattern? Another important question is if the patterns displayed are at a biological steady state or does pattern formation stop prematurely?
