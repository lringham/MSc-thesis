\chapter{Principles of reaction-diffusion patterning} 
Alan Turing proposed a system of differential equations as a model for biological pattern formation \citep{turing1952}. In this system, a spatial medium contains an initially homogeneous distribution of chemicals. This arrangement is in unstable equilibrium and the presence of small chemical perturbations instigates pattern formation. The system responds in a few ways over time: it can gain stability in a patterned state, oscillate between patterns, or settle in a homogeneous non-patterned state. 

\section{Reaction-diffusion in a continuous domain}
Reaction-diffusion is formalized as a set of PDEs that represent the change in concentration of morphogens over time. Considering morphogens $a$ and $b$, a two-substance reaction-diffusion system is defined by the system of equations:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:basicRD}
		\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} &= F(a, b) + D_a \Lap a,\\
		\frac{\partial b}{\partial t} &= G(a, b) + D_b \Lap b.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
As the name suggests, reaction-diffusion is composed of two mechanisms, reaction and diffusion. Functions $F$ and $G$ describe the production and decay of $a$ and $b$, and together constitute the reactions of the system. $D_a$ and $D_b$ are coefficients that control how fast these morphogens diffuse through the domain. Physically, they depend on the morphogen particle size and permeability of the domain. $\Lap{}$ is the Laplacian operator, and in conjunction with the diffusion coefficients, describes the diffusion component of the system.

These equations apply at any position in the domain in which reaction-diffusion is occurring. The size, shape, and growth of this domain may also play a role in pattern formation. Some patterns require a minimum amount of space to form. As domain size increases, the same parameters can produce different patterns. Additionally, the shape of the domain can affect pattern positioning and orientation.

\section{Reaction-diffusion models}
\subsection{The Turing model}
\citet{turing1952} considered reaction-diffusion on both a discrete and continuous 1D ring. Initially, morphogen concentrations would be constant across the domain and the system would be in a stable state. Low-amplitude noise would then instigate pattern formation. The equations he proposed had the form:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:turingRD}
			\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &= s(uv-v-\beta) + D_v \Lap v,\\
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= s(\alpha-uv) + D_u \Lap u.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
The morphogen $u$ has a base production $\alpha$. The $uv$ term describes the rate at which the morphogen $u$ is converted into the morphogen $v$. Changes to $s$, the reaction rate, scale the pattern features. For example, a spot pattern will appear larger with smaller values of parameter $s$. $\beta$ controls a constant removal of $v$.

\subsection{The activator-inhibitor model}
The concept of reaction-diffusion was reinvented by \citet{gierer1972} (see also \citep{meinhardt1982}). They considered two morphogens, an activator $a$ and an inhibitor $h$. The activator is autocatalytic, using itself to reproduce. It also spurs the production of the inhibitor, which slows autocatalysis. The interplay between these two actions is what allows for patterns to form. Meinhardt and Gierer advanced the idea that pattern formation depended on is the activator diffusing much slower than the inhibitor. Often this is the case, but such drastic differences in diffusion are not always needed \citep{gray1984, marcon2016}. The activator-inhibitor model is defined as:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:activatorInhibitorRD}
			\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} &= \rho \frac{a^2}{h} - \mu_a a + \rho_a + D_a \Lap a,\\
			\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} &= \rho a^2 - \mu_h h  + \rho_h + D_h \Lap h.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
In these equations, $\rho$ is the reaction rate. $\mu_a$ and $\mu_h$ are the decay rates of $a$ and $h$. $\rho_a$ and $\rho_h$ represent the base production of $a$ and $h$. 

\subsection{The activator-depleted substrate model}
The activator-depleted substrate model is another model proposed by \citet{gierer1972}. In this model, the inhibitor is replaced by a substrate that the activator uses to perform autocatalysis. The inhibition mechanism results from the depletion through the consumption of the substrate by the activator. This is represented by the equations:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:activatorSubstrateRD}
		\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} &= \rho sa^2 - \mu_a a + \rho_a + D_a \Lap a,\\
		\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} &= -\rho sa^2 - \mu_s s + \rho_s + D_s \Lap s.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
Here $\rho$ is the reaction rate, $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s$ are the decay rates, and $\rho_a$ and $\rho_s$ are the base production rates of $a$ and $s$.

\subsection{The Gray-Scott model}
\citet{gray1984} investigated the behaviour of a simple irreversible set of reactions and discovered it produced interesting patterns. These reactions occur in an isothermal, continuously stirred tank reactor into which chemicals $U$ is continuously fed. $V$ reacts with $U$ in the tank and decays into an inert product $P$. This system is known as the Gray-Scott model, and the reactions are formalized as:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		U + 2V &\to 3V, \\
		V &\to P.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
When represented as partial differential equations, this system has the form:
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned} \label{eq:grayscottRD}
		\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &= uv^2 - (F+k)v + D_v \Lap v,\\
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= -uv^2 + F(1-u) + D_u \Lap u.
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
$uv^2$ represents $U + 2V \to 3V$ and the constant $k$ controls the rate at which $V \to P$ occurs. $F$ is a scalar parameter that controls how much of $u$ is fed into the system and the proportion of $u \text{ and } v$ that is removed. The feeding and removal of $u$ is controlled by $F$ which has the effect of trying to keep the concentration of $u$ near $1$. Remarkably, the diffusivity coefficients use a ratio of 1:2 for the activator and substrate, which is a smaller ratio than considered by Gierer and Meinhardt. Except for a narrow range of parameters, pattern formation in this system is not instigated by noise. A pre-pattern is required to start pattern formation. 

The Gray-Scott model is a specific case of the activator-depleted substrate model. Using the substitutions: $a = v$, $s = u$, $\rho = 1$, $\rho_a = 0$, $\mu_a = F+k$, $\rho_s = F$, and $\mu_s = F$, we obtain Eqn. \ref{eq:activatorSubstrateRD}. \citet{pearson1993} extensively explored and visualized the Gray-Scott model in 2D and produced many diverse patterns (Fig. \ref{fig:grayscottParameterMap}).

\section{Extensions to basic reaction-diffusion}
The basic reaction-diffusion concept proposed by Turing and contextualized by Gierer and Meinhardt has provided the tools for reasoning about natural pattern formation. From that idealized system, we consider extensions to represent nature and produce realistic patterns more accurately.

% Non-homogeneities 
One such extension is changing parameters based on their position in the domain. A commonly changed parameter is the diffusion rate. Increasing the diffusion rate along the domain causes patterns such as meandering stripes to exhibit a preferred orientation \citep{zheng2009}. \citet{witkin1991} also varied diffusion rates to correct for pattern distortion on curved surfaces. The change of parameters in space can be driven by images to create intricate patterns for artistic renderings. 

% Anisotropic diffusion
Not only does diffusion vary, it can be anisotropic due to the heterogeneous structure of tissue. \citet{zhou2007} modelled pigment patterns on flower petals by considering the influence of veins on diffusion. The diffusion between adjacent cells is modified based on the presence of vascular cells. Adding consideration for vein width results in darker pigment patterns along veins, as seen in real flowers such as orchids. \citet{sanderson2004} used anisotropic diffusion with reaction-diffusion to visualize vector fields. A uniform spot pattern has its diffusion driven by an underlying vector field that produces distorted ovals. In a study of snake pattern diversity, \citet{allen2013} used anisotropic diffusion to model various snakeskin patterns and associated them with snake behaviour.

% Growth controlled by pattern or pattern affected by growth
Domain growth can affect morphogen patterns. Patterns may form before growth is finished, and subsequent growth will cause patterns to stretch and deform. Alternatively, patterns can develop in tandem with growth, adjusting and migrating with available space. \citet{kondo1995} modelled the stripe patterns found on the angelfish \textit{Pomacanthus} by considering pattern formation during growth. The pattern is not affixed to the underlying skin and gains new stripes that insert between existing ones over time. Similarly, \citet{murray1991} modelled the effect of growth on snakeskin pigment pattern formation. \citet{fowler1992} modelled patterns formed on a growing 1D seashell margin. Pattern-driven growth couples the growth rate of the surface with morphogen concentrations. \citet{lefevre2010} used pattern-driven growth to model brain development. This coupling has also been used to simulate structure formation in plants \citep{harrison2002, holloway2007}.  

% multi chemical or multi-stage
Multi-stage models where parameter values change over time have been used to simulate the pigment patterns on leopards and jaguars \citep{liu2006}. \citet{malheiros2017} simulated moray eel spots by varying diffusion rates and changing morphogen saturation limits on different areas of the body. Changing these parameters had the effect of creating irregular spots that changed into a thicker labyrinth-like pattern. Having more than two morphogens allows for different patterns. \citet{schenk2000} created a three-morphogen model that produces a pattern of spot clusters that move together as a group. \citet{meinhardt1982} created a five-morphogen model that produced zebra-like stripe patterns.

Due to high sensitivity to small changes in parameters and the dependence on a difference in diffusion rates, it is hard to justify reaction-diffusion models as a representation of nature. Stationary cells are an example of immobile cell-autonomous factors that play a role in real pattern formation. They can be represented as non-diffusing morphogens but are usually abstracted away when creating a model. Omitting non-diffusing morphogens is done to simplify the model and focus on the obvious morphogens. In a study by \citet{marcon2016}, they found that 70\% of three or four-morphogen systems, including non-diffusing morphogens, do not require differing diffusion rates. Also, the patterns formed by these models are much less sensitive to parameter changes. Including these non-diffusing morphogens provides a closer representation of reality and suggests that some basic assumptions, such as long-range inhibition and short-range activation, should be used as a special case rather than the standard when modelling biological patterns.
