\chapter{Case Study 2: Snakes}
\section{Literature Review}
Snakes are long legless reptiles that display many pigmentation patterns such as longitudinal and transverse stripes and blotches, some of which are shown in Fig \ref{fig:realSnakePatterns}. The snake is entirely covered in scales. The top of which is made of translucent keratin. Under this top layer is where pigmentation patterns are found. Although the keratin is translucent, it may contribute to the pattern's appearance by acting as prisms through which light refracts, producing an iridescent sheen. Scales may also limit diffusion of pigments across the scale boundary as seen in the ocellated lizard \cite{manukyan2017}.

Pigmentation patterns perform many useful functions, such as hiding the snake from prey and helping the snake itself avoid becoming prey. These functions are fulfilled by camouflaging the snake from potential predators or acting as a brightly coloured warning signal that the snake may be venomous. An example warning pattern is seen on the north American coral snake, \textit{Micrurus fulvius}, with its distinctive red, yellow, and black coloured bands \hl{cite}. Some non-venomous snakes employ mimicry as a defence mechanism by displaying a pattern like a venomous snake’s. A well-known example of this is the scarlet king snake, \hl{Lampropeltis elapsoides}, who also displays red, black and yellow bands like \textit{M. fulvius}, shown in Fig \ref{fig:realSnakePatterns}.

The regions of a snake that display pigmentation patterns can be roughly partitioned as the head, body, tail, and underbelly \hl{cite?}. The main patterns of interest in this work occur on the body and tail, which are often indistinguishable. The similarity between patterns found on these regions and those found on the head or underbelly vary between species. It is not uncommon for the head or underbelly to display a different pattern than each other or what is seen on the body. This may be due to the difference in scale shape between regions as well as the visibility and importance of these regions \hl{ref}. A notable example is the ring-necked Snake which presents a plain brown color on its back which serves as camouflage. When the ring-necked snake is provoked, it will display its bright red and orange underside to deter predators.

Patterns on the ocellated lizard have been simulated by \cite{manukyan2017}. These lizards are covered in a quasi-hexagonal lattice of pigmented scales. As a juvenile, the lizard's scales display white spots on a brown background. This pattern changes in adults, whose scales are coloured individually either a solid green or black. These scales also switch between colours over the lifetime of the lizard. By studying pattern formation on ocellated lizards over three to four years, it was found that the colouration of each scale can be modelled by a reaction-diffusion system with diffusion varying across the scale boundaries. Consequently, the diffusion between scales is much slower than inside an individual scale. This results in scales acting as cells in a discrete reaction-diffusion model. Remarkably, this reaction-diffusion system behaves as a cellular automaton when the diffusion between scales is low enough.

Many natural patterns are seen in their final stable state or at a single point during their development. Observations of development over time are often difficult to observe because pattern formation occurs slowly or during a time when the animal is very young. The development of pigmentation patterns has been studied in Japanese four-lined snakes (\textit{Elaphe quadrivirgata}) \cite{murakami2018}. At different points in time during embryonic development, these snakes were measured to gain an understanding of their physical and pigmentation changes. The characteristic pattern \textit{E. quadrivirgata} displays is light brown background color with four black lateral lines. In juveniles, these stripes are dark brown and connected like a ladder. Pigmentation striped patterns were first seen to emerge behind the head after 26-32 days. Then appears on the whole body first thinly at 29-35 days and then clearly at 40-42 days. This pattern development continues after the snake has hatched. These observations are valuable because they give insight into the required initial conditions of a reaction-diffusion simulation.

patterns have been simulated in marcelo paper. This work does not use a reaction-diffusion model, but a reaction diffusion pattern is used as the starting point to pattern formation. \cite{pinheiro2017}.

Snake pattern diversity has been studied by using reaction-diffusion as a method to quantify snake patterns \cite{Allen2013}. This quantification was achieved by having users compare snake-like reaction-diffusion patterns on grid against real snake images. This provided an association between a reaction-diffusion model and a real image resulting in a parameter representation of the real snake’s pattern. These parameters represent visual features such as pattern size, complexity, and anisotropy. This representation implies that snake pattern evolution is then represented by changes in parameter values. To gain insight into how patterns are related to snake behaviour and their environment, these parameters are associated with “ecological and behavioral variables to understand the drivers of pattern diversity in a phylogenetic context”. This analysis suggested that snake patterns are mainly driven by behaviour rather than the environment the snakes inhabited. 

Snake patterns have been simulated through reaction-diffusion in \cite{MURRAY1991}. This work uses chemotaxis, which is the effect of cell movement to areas of high chemical concentration. These patterns have been implemented on gecko meshes as in \hl{[gecko ppr]}. 

\section{Model Description}
\hl{need models with growth, to highlight and justify the program feature}

One model forms stripes and then grows to produce double stripes as seen in the copperhead.
